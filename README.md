# Python Games and Projects
## This is my personally developed collection of games and projects
#### To run a game, follow these commands:


```
git clone https://github.com/gsowjanya97/python-games.git
cd python-games
python <file name>
```
P.S. If you want to share any ideas for improving or simplifyng the code, I would be happy to receive any suggestions and PRs ðŸ˜„
